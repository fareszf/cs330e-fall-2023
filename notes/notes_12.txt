cache_1 and cahe_2
DecoratorsT.py shows the test cases to build a cache to store the cycle lengths.
The cache, cache_1, receives a function, f, and returns a function, g. 
cache_1 utilizes a cache, d. Every time cache_1(f) is called, d and g 
are allocated and occupy their own memory locations, so when g is returned 
you now have a function that acts as wrapper for f that utilizes a unique cache.
